## Dataset Used
- Superstore Sales Dataset
- Historical transaction-level sales data
- Aggregated to monthly sales for forecasting

## Data Processing Steps
- Converted Order Date column to datetime format
- Aggregated sales data on a monthly basis
- Created time-based features (Month and Year)

## Model Used
- Linear Regression (Scikit-learn)

## Model Evaluation
- Evaluation Metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- The model captures overall sales trends effectively

## Results & Visualization
- Monthly sales trend visualization
- Actual vs Predicted monthly sales comparison plot

## Business Insights
- Sales exhibit seasonal patterns across different months
